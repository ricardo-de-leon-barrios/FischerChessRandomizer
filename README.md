# Fischer Chess Randomizer

Fischer ramdom chess or Chess960 is a variation of chess where the starting position of the pieces on the players' home ranks is randomized, taking into account a set of rules:
- The king must be situated between the two rooks.
- The two bishops must occupy squares with opposite colors.

This program randomly generates a starting position for people who desire to play a game of Chess960.

This is still an alpha version. I'm gonna be working on a GUI in the next few days.
